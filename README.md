The "charge master" (or CM file) is a detailed list of hospital charges, including prices for individual services, supplies, procedures, and medications, used by hospitals to bill patients and insurers. It is a comprehensive and standardized dataset that reflects the hospital's pricing structure for all billable items and services provided.

Key Aspects of the Hospital Charge Master:
Content: It includes detailed descriptions, billing codes (such as CPT or HCPCS), units, and prices for hundreds or thousands of services, procedures, and supplies.

Purpose: It facilitates billing, insurance reimbursements, and transparency efforts, enabling patients and payers to understand the charges associated with hospital services.

Regulations: Hospitals in California and nationwide are required to make their charge masters publicly available in machine-readable formats (such as JSON or CSV) in compliance with federal and state transparency laws, including CMS mandates and state-specific requirements.​

Accessibility and Usage:
Hospitals often publish charge master files on their websites and submit them to regulatory bodies like the California Hospital Association (CHA) or Health Care Cost Transparency portal.​

Examples include publicly available files, which are regularly updated (annually or more frequently), to reflect current pricing and service descriptions.​

Summary:
A hospital charge master is an exhaustive database of the hospital’s prices for all billable healthcare services, serving as the foundation for billing and transparency initiatives. It typically includes detailed descriptions, codes, and prices, and is publicly accessible for the sake of transparency and consumer awareness.
